## Airbnb Listings in Washington, DC üè†

<div>
We begin our story with a fundamental question: "Why should hosts consider their pricing strategy?" A strange fact is made clear by the first plot: there is, at most, a shaky correlation between price and guest ratings or minimum stay requirements. An investigation into the many factors that influence listing pricing is warranted by a dense cluster of postings that fall below the $1,000 criterion.

## Properties affecting pricing

<div>We then analyze how specifics about the property affect pricing. The second plot tells the tale of several interconnected elements that come together in a complex ballet: cost, ratings, and bathroom and bedroom characteristics. It dispels the notion that these factors influence pricing, encouraging us to look more broadly.</div>

Plot 3's 3D scatter plot again telling the absence of a strong correlation between prices and conventional property features like bedrooms and baths. The diverse price points suggest that there are additional layers to the story.

## Price distribution among neighborhoods

<div>
Knowing the popular accommodation types sets the stage for an in-depth look at the price ranges within these neighborhoods, which could influence a host's decision on where to position their price point.
The box plot underscores the variability within each neighborhood, detailing the high and low ends of pricing. Hosts can use this information to position their listing within the spectrum, considering both average rates and the range of what guests pay.

<h2>Relationship between price with number of baths and bedrooms</h2>

<div>
To clarify the relationship between price with number of baths and bedrooms, the forth heatmap here zooms in on the majority of house types - predominantly one-bedroom and one-bathroom listings. Here, we observe that if these features were the main drivers of price, we wouldn't witness such a broad price range spanning from $0 to $1k. Instead, we'd see a concentrated cluster, implying that there must be other, less visible forces at play.

<h2> Questions? </h2>

Above plots prompt a deeper dive into the subjective factors of guest experience. What qualities do guests actually talk about, and how do those preferences align with their willingness to pay?
