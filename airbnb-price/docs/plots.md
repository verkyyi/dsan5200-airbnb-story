## Airbnb Listings in Washington, DC üè†

<div>
Our visual tale starts with an interactive bubble plot that answers the basic query, "Why should hosts consider their pricing strategy?" The plot's depth and versatility are designed in such a way that users can zoom in on particular price ranges, filter or isolate neighborhoods of interest, then double-click to return to the entire view. Hosts can learn more about a particular listing's neighborhood, price, rating, and required number of nights by swiping over each bubble. This feature provides a detailed perspective of the data in addition to highlighting an important finding: there is, at most, a weak association between pricing and minimum night stays or guest ratings. The plot prominently features a cluster of listings under $1,000, casting doubt on the notion that listings with greater prices are invariably accompanied by higher ratings or longer stays. It also encourages a more thorough examination of the numerous variables that influence a listing's value.

## Properties affecting pricing

<div>We then analyze how specifics about the property affect pricing. The second plot tells the tale of several interconnected elements that come together in a complex ballet: cost, ratings, and bathroom and bedroom characteristics. It dispels the notion that these factors influence pricing, encouraging us to look more broadly.</div>

Plot 3's 3D scatter plot again telling the absence of a strong correlation between prices and conventional property features like bedrooms and baths. The diverse price points suggest that there are additional layers to the story.

## Price distribution among neighborhoods

<div>
Knowing the popular accommodation types sets the stage for an in-depth look at the price ranges within these neighborhoods, which could influence a host's decision on where to position their price point.
The box plot underscores the variability within each neighborhood, detailing the high and low ends of pricing. Hosts can use this information to position their listing within the spectrum, considering both average rates and the range of what guests pay.

<h2>Relationship between price with number of baths and bedrooms</h2>

<div>
To clarify the relationship between price with number of baths and bedrooms, the forth heatmap here zooms in on the majority of house types - predominantly one-bedroom and one-bathroom listings. Here, we observe that if these features were the main drivers of price, we wouldn't witness such a broad price range spanning from $0 to $1k. Instead, we'd see a concentrated cluster, implying that there must be other, less visible forces at play.
