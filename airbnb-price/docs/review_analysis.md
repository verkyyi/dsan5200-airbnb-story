# Review Text Analysis

<div>
The word cloud offers direct insight into the guest experience, highlighting 'location' as a key determinant in top-tier pricing, along with 'clean' and 'comfortable.' These terms reflect the premium aspects that guests value, potentially guiding hosts on what to emphasize in their listings. By comparing the word cloud plots of reviews from top 10% price and bottom 10% price, we can find some words repetitively shown up but also some words different. For example, ‚Äúlocation‚Äù, ‚Äúclean‚Äù, ‚Äúhighly recommend‚Äù and ‚Äúrooms‚Äù, which show that no matter for low-price customers or high-price customers, they are all expect have good experience with good location, clean house, and better room decorations. However, they are some slightly different words that can be seen in both wordcloud plots. For example, for high-price customers, they are looking for parking lot, and valet service, however for low-price customers, they are looking for metro stations. What‚Äôs more, we can see more positive descriptive words in high price reviews, however, there are some negative words in low price reviews, like ‚Äúdie‚Äù and ‚Äúsmall‚Äù. This may indicate that higher price listings would provide better service that would satisfy customers.
